  <AM_AtheismDescription.rules.rulesStrings.19>atheismlessonIntro->There is something infantile in the presumption that somebody else has a responsibility to give your life meaning and point. Only you can realize that</AM_AtheismDescription.rules.rulesStrings.19>
  <AM_AtheismDescription.rules.rulesStrings.20>atheismlessonIntro->Being a Humanist means trying to behave decently without expectation of rewards or punishment after you are dead. You will show everyone that</AM_AtheismDescription.rules.rulesStrings.20>
  <AM_AtheismDescription.rules.rulesStrings.21>atheismlessonIntro->When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion.

  <AM_AtheismDescription.rules.rulesStrings.29>atheismlessonReinforcement->We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes.</AM_AtheismDescription.rules.rulesStrings.29>

But he doesn’t realize that the same fate is soon to overtake him also. That man is a fool. He needs to realize that</AM_JainistDescription.rules.rulesStrings.25>
  <AM_JainistDescription.rules.rulesStrings.26>jainistlessonIntro->Attachment and aversion are the root cause of karma, and karma originates from infatuation.
